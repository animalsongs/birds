## Overview

This package contains the python implementation of the motor gestures model for birdsongs developed by Gabo Mindlin. The comparable synthetic birdsongs is generated by solving a minimization problem using the fundamental frequency (FF) and spectral content index (SCI) as parameteres. The sound analysis is performed with librosa and the solution is computed with modules of optimization of scipy. 

The data is downloaded from Xeno Canto and eBird, the model is tested with the Zonotrichia Capensis, Ocellated Tapaculo, and Mimus Gilvus. The results obtained achived a relative error less than 5 % in the FF for the Zonotrichia Capensis.

## Installation

### Requirments

`wavesong` is tested in Python 3.10 or higher. The required libraries are listed in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.
    
### Environment

First of all, let's create an evironment for the project. This can be done in three ways:

#### Python

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv    # install virtual environments
python3 -m venv ./venv           # create venv
source ./venv/bin/activate       # activate venv
```

If you are working on Windows, activate the venv with ```source /venv/bin/Activate```.

#### Conda

```bash
conda create -n wavesongs python=3.12
conda activate wavesongs
```

#### Docker

In process...

```bash
docker build -t wavesongs .
docker run -p 8888:8888 wavesongs
```

### WaveSongs

Now, clone the the **wavesongs** repository and enter to it.

```bat
git clone https://github.com/wavesongs/wavesongs
cd wavesongs
```

Next, install the package and the required libraries. To do this there are two options:

1. `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ``` 

2. [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/):


    ```bat
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    ```

    For more information visit [Installing pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/#installing-pipx). You can install poetry with `pipx install poetry`. 
    
    Finally, install **wavesongs** with: 

    ```bat
    poetry install
    ```

If you are using an IDE, reset it.

That's all!. Now let's create a synthetic song!
